## Core Philosophy

CleanCue v0.2.4 represents a return to simplicity:
- **Removed 1.1GB workers package** in favor of lightweight solutions
- **JSON storage** instead of complex database systems
- **Direct tool integration** (yt-dlp) instead of abstraction layers
- **Modular testing** enabling easy validation of individual components
- **Preserved full DJ functionality** while drastically reducing complexity

The result is a system that's easier to understand, test, and maintain while delivering all the professional DJ features you need.

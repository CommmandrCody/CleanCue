ðŸ”„ Key Changes

Removed 1.1GB workers package
Eliminated the bulky workers dependency. Replaced with lightweight direct integrations to reduce footprint and improve performance.

Adopted JSON-based storage
Transitioned from a traditional database to a simple, JSON-based storage engine. This reduces overhead and simplifies both setup and maintenance.

Direct tool integration
Integrated core tools (yt-dlp, librosa, etc.) directly, removing redundant abstraction layers. This makes the system easier to debug and extend yet highly-configurabale.

Improved modular testing
Enhanced test coverage with a focus on modular validation of individual components. This ensures stability and simplifies future development.

Preserved full DJ feature set
Despite simplification, all core DJ features remain intact, including BPM detection, key analysis, energy scoring, **cue points**, and audio integration.

**Cue points are experimental in this release

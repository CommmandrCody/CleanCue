# 🛠️ CleanCue Development Notes

## 🚀 Current Status

**Ready for Public Launch**:
- ✅ Desktop applications (Mac Intel/ARM, Windows 32/64-bit)
- ✅ Web UI with React/Vite
- ✅ Audio analysis workers (BPM, key, energy detection)
- ✅ Universal export system (5 DJ software formats)
- ✅ Cross-platform build system

**Work in Progress**:
- 🔧 CLI Package - TypeScript event type mismatches (temporarily excluded from build)

## 📦 Package Status

| Package | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `packages/shared` | ✅ Ready | TypeScript types and shared utilities |
| `packages/engine` | ✅ Ready | Core business logic and export system |
| `packages/workers` | ✅ Ready | Python audio analysis workers |
| `packages/ui` | ✅ Ready | React web interface |
| `packages/cli` | 🔧 WIP | Command-line interface (TypeScript fixes needed) |
| `apps/desktop` | ✅ Ready | Electron desktop application |

## 🔧 Known Issues

### CLI Package TypeScript Errors
The CLI package has event listener type mismatches that prevent compilation:
- Event handler property access errors in `src/index.ts`
- Method name mismatches (`getTracks` vs `getTrack`)

**Solution**: Update event types in shared package or add proper type guards in CLI handlers.

### Build System
- CLI temporarily excluded from workspace build via `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- All other packages build successfully with TypeScript and bundlers

## 🚀 Pre-Launch Checklist

- [x] Core functionality tested and working
- [x] Cross-platform builds successful
- [x] Documentation complete (README, LICENSE)
- [x] Repository cleaned of sensitive files
- [x] Git ignore properly configured
- [x] Launch strategy documented
- [x] Testing infrastructure created
- [ ] CLI package fixed (post-launch priority)

## 📋 Post-Launch Development Priorities

1. **Fix CLI Package** - Resolve TypeScript compilation errors
2. **Community Feedback** - Address user-reported issues and feature requests
3. **Performance Optimization** - Based on real-world usage patterns
4. **Additional Export Formats** - Community-requested DJ software support
5. **Enhanced Key Detection** - Improve accuracy with real music content

## 🤝 Contributing

**For New Contributors**:
1. Focus on the working packages (shared, engine, workers, ui, desktop)
2. CLI fixes welcome but not required for core functionality
3. All builds should pass before submitting PRs
4. Test with the synthetic audio generator in `docs/`

**Build Commands**:
```bash
pnpm install           # Install all dependencies
pnpm build            # Build all packages (excluding CLI)
pnpm dev:ui           # Start web development server
pnpm dev:desktop      # Start desktop app in development mode
```

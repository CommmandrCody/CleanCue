## Commands Reference

### `cleancue scan <path> [path2] [path3] ...`

Scan directories for music files with real-time progress reporting.

```bash
# Basic scanning
cleancue scan ~/Music/DJ\ Collection

# Multiple directories
cleancue scan ~/Music ~/Downloads/tracks /Volumes/External/Music

# What you'll see:
üîç Starting scan of 3 path(s)...
üìÇ Scanning: 45% (127/283) - track_name.mp3

## Automation & Scripting

### Batch Processing Workflow

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Professional DJ library maintenance script

echo "üéß Starting CleanCue batch processing..."

# Scan new music directories
cleancue scan ~/Music/New\ Tracks ~/Downloads/DJ\ Music

# Analyze everything that needs analysis
cleancue analyze all

# Generate statistics report
echo "üìä Current Library Status:"
cleancue stats

# List recently added tracks
echo "üÜï Recently Added:"
cleancue list 10

echo "‚úÖ Batch processing complete!"
```

### Integration Examples

```bash
# Check if analysis is complete before export
ANALYZED=$(cleancue stats | grep "BPM/Tempo analyzed" | cut -d'(' -f2 | cut -d'%' -f1)
if [ "$ANALYZED" -eq 100 ]; then
    echo "Library fully analyzed - ready for export"
else
    echo "Analysis incomplete: ${ANALYZED}% - running full analysis"
    cleancue analyze all
fi

# Find tracks without BPM analysis
cleancue list 1000 | grep "‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢" | head -20  # Tracks missing BPM data
```

### Cron Job for Automatic Processing

```bash
# Add to crontab for daily library maintenance
# 0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/cleancue scan ~/Music && /usr/local/bin/cleancue analyze all

# Weekly comprehensive analysis
# 0 3 * * 0 /usr/local/bin/cleancue analyze all
```

## Advanced Features

### Progress Monitoring

All long-running operations show detailed progress:
- **Scanning**: File count, current file being processed
- **Analysis**: Percentage complete, current track
- **Error Handling**: Specific error messages with file paths

### Real-time Events

The CLI engine emits detailed events:
- `scan:started` - Begin library scanning
- `scan:progress` - File-by-file scanning progress
- `scan:completed` - Summary with counts and errors
- `analysis:started` - Begin track analysis
- `analysis:progress` - Analysis progress percentage
- `analysis:completed` - Analysis results

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error reporting:
```bash
‚ùå Scan complete: 15 added, 3 updated, 2 errors
‚ùå Errors encountered:
   /path/to/corrupt.mp3: Unable to read metadata
   /path/to/invalid.wav: Unsupported audio format
```

---

## Performance & Optimization

### Large Library Handling

CleanCue is optimized for professional libraries:
- **Memory efficient**: Processes files individually, not in bulk
- **Interruption safe**: Can resume scanning/analysis after interruption
- **Progress tracking**: Always know where you are in large operations
- **Error isolation**: One bad file doesn't stop the entire process

### Batch Operations

```bash
# Process multiple directories efficiently
find ~/Music -name "*.mp3" -print0 | xargs -0 dirname | sort -u | while read dir; do
    cleancue scan "$dir"
done
```

---

## Integration with UI

The CLI and desktop UI share the same engine and database:
- **Seamless switching**: Use CLI for automation, UI for interaction
- **Shared progress**: Operations started in CLI visible in UI
- **Consistent results**: Identical analysis results across interfaces
- **Real-time sync**: Changes in CLI immediately reflected in UI

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Command not found"**
```bash
# Ensure CleanCue is properly installed
which cleancue
# Should show: /usr/local/bin/cleancue or similar
```

**"Database connection failed"**
```bash
# Run health check
cleancue doctor
# Check database permissions and storage space
```

**"Analysis failed"**
```bash
# Verify Python dependencies
cleancue doctor
# Check individual file with detailed error
cleancue analyze tempo --verbose
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose logging (when available)
DEBUG=cleancue:* cleancue scan ~/Music
```

---

## Why CLI Matters for DJs

**Professional Workflows**: Automate repetitive tasks, batch process new music
**Transparency**: See exactly what algorithms are doing to your tracks
**Integration**: Build CleanCue into larger automation systems
**Reliability**: Script complex operations that run unattended
**Control**: Fine-grained control over analysis parameters

Unlike proprietary DJ software, CleanCue gives you **complete visibility and control** over your music library management.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Try the examples** above with your music library
2. **Build automation scripts** for your specific workflow
3. **Combine with UI** for the best of both worlds
4. **Share scripts** with the CleanCue community

**Remember**: The CLI and UI are equally powerful - use whatever fits your workflow best. Power users often use CLI for automation and UI for interactive work.

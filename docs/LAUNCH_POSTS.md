### **DJTechTools Community Post**

**Subject**: "Built a free library manager to export between DJ software - feedback?"

**Body**:
```
Hey everyone! üëã

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I've been DJing for [years] and got frustrated with being locked into one software ecosystem. You know the pain - you build a huge library in Serato, then want to try Engine DJ, but all your BPM/key analysis and playlists are trapped.

So I built something to fix this. It's called CleanCue - basically a library manager that:
‚Ä¢ Analyzes your music once (BPM, key, energy)
‚Ä¢ Exports clean playlists to ANY DJ software (Serato, Engine DJ, Rekordbox, Traktor, M3U)
‚Ä¢ Finds and removes duplicates
‚Ä¢ Works on Mac and Windows

It's completely free and open-source. No subscriptions, no vendor lock-in.

I'm sharing it here because this community always helps each other out. Would love feedback from fellow DJs - does this solve a real problem for you? What would make it more useful?

Built by a DJ, for DJs who need professional tools without the professional price tag.

Thoughts?

### **Native Instruments Community (Traktor Focus)**

**Subject**: "Free tool to import libraries from other DJ software into Traktor"

**Body**:
```
Fellow Traktor users,

Wondering if this would be useful to the community - I created a free tool that helps migrate libraries TO Traktor from other DJ software.

The problem: You have a huge library in Serato/Rekordbox/Engine DJ with BPM and key analysis, but moving to Traktor means starting over with analysis.

The solution: CleanCue analyzes your music and exports it in Traktor's NML format, preserving BPM, key, and metadata.

It also works the other way - export FROM Traktor to other software if you want to try something new.

Free, open-source, no strings attached. Built it because I was tired of vendor lock-in limiting my software choices.

Anyone interested in testing this? Always looking for ways to make the DJ workflow smoother.

### **Serato Forums Post**

**Subject**: "Library backup/export tool - preserve your Serato analysis"

**Body**:
```
Serato family,

Quick question - how do you backup your library analysis when switching between systems or trying new software?

I ran into this problem when I wanted to export my Serato library for gigs where I needed to use different software. Spent months analyzing tracks, didn't want to lose that work.

Created a tool called CleanCue that backs up your library in universal formats. It can:
- Export your Serato crates with BPM/key data intact
- Convert to other formats if needed (Engine DJ, Rekordbox, etc.)
- Create M3U playlists for USB sticks
- Find duplicate tracks eating up storage

Thought other Serato users might find it useful. It's free and doesn't mess with your Serato database - just creates export files.

Anyone else dealing with library backup challenges?

Hi [Name],

Love your content on [specific video/article]. Your recent piece on [relevant topic] really resonated.

I'm a working DJ who built something the community might find useful - a free, open-source library manager called CleanCue.

The problem it solves: DJ software vendor lock-in. Once you build a library in one platform, you're stuck. Want to try Engine DJ but have a huge Serato library? You lose all your BPM/key analysis.

CleanCue analyzes music once and exports to ALL major DJ software formats. It's saved me countless hours when prepping for gigs with different setups.

Would this be relevant for your audience? Happy to provide a review copy, demo, or just chat about the DJ workflow problems it solves.

No pressure - just thought fellow DJs might appreciate having their music library freedom back.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. It's completely free and open-source. No business model, just solving a problem I had.

## üéØ **Key Messaging Principles**

1. **Lead with the problem**, not the solution
2. **Share personal experience** ("I was frustrated with...")
3. **Focus on community benefit** ("thought other DJs might...")
4. **Be humble and ask for feedback** ("would love thoughts...")
5. **Emphasize free/no-catch** (builds trust)
6. **Use DJ language** (gigs, setups, workflows)

## üìÖ **Launch Sequence Timing**

**Week 1**: Forums + Discord communities
**Week 2**: Social media + direct outreach
**Week 3**: Reddit (with momentum from other channels)
**Week 4**: Follow up, community building

**Remember**: You're not selling anything. You're a DJ sharing a solution to a problem every DJ has faced. That authentic perspective is your biggest asset! üéß

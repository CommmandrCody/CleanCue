# CleanCue – Core Vision & Strategy

## Vision

**To give DJs and producers the tool we’ve all wished existed: clean, reliable, and universal library prep that doesn’t get in the way of the music.**

This isn’t another “app from the outside.” CleanCue is being built by someone who’s lived every step of the process—programmer, product manager, audio engineer, DJ, and producer. I’ve felt the same late-night frustration with broken grids, messy tags, and endless file cleanup before a gig. CleanCue is the answer I couldn’t find anywhere else.

## Mission

* **Free up the creative headspace** → Automate the grunt work, so the hours before a set aren’t lost to metadata hell.
* **Respect every workflow** → Whether you’re on Serato, Engine DJ, Rekordbox, or Traktor, CleanCue meets you where you are.
* **Build for trust** → Transparent analysis, clear logs, and data you can count on.
* **Grow with the community** → Start lean with a CLI for power users, then expand into simple tools anyone can use.

## Core Strategy

### 1. **Foundation: The Library You Can Trust**

* CLI-first engine that fixes filenames, cleans tags, detects BPM/key, and spots broken or outlier files.
* Accuracy and transparency over “magic black boxes.”
* Always scriptable, always flexible — DJs deserve control.

### 2. **Seamless Compatibility**

* Normalize libraries into a **universal schema**.
* Export adapters for Serato, Engine DJ, Rekordbox, and Traktor.
* Optional platform-specific tuning (so Engine grids feel like Engine, Serato crates feel like Serato).

### 3. **Workflow Enhancements**

* Energy detection, auto cue generation, smart crate building.
* yt-dl/ffmpeg integration for track prep pipelines.
* Resume workflows instead of starting over — a lifesaver when juggling massive playlists.

### 4. **Community at the Core**

* GitHub-driven, open source, with issues and features shaped in the open.
* Made to be forked, tweaked, and remixed — like a good track.
* Recognition and contribution, not profit, are what fuel the project.

### 5. **The Long Game**

* Sync libraries across devices (local first, cloud optional).
* AI-powered cue/beatgrid suggestions built on real-world DJ use, not lab theory.
* Marketplace of community crates, cue packs, and metadata corrections.

## Positioning

* **Not Lexicon** → no bloat, no lock-in, just clean workflows.
* **Not Mixed In Key** → open, accurate, universal — not another black box.
* **Not a record pool** → this isn’t about selling you music, it’s about fixing the music you already love.

---

## What We’ve Done So Far

* Laid down the **repo skeleton** for CLI and future UI.
* Locked in the **stack** (Node/PNPM, with React desktop down the line).
* Defined the **real user path**: start private MVP testing with trusted friends → iterate fast → open to the wider DJ community.
* Built around the **pain points we know firsthand**: missing track numbers, broken tags, dodgy BPMs, and time lost to prep.

✨ **CleanCue isn’t being built by a company trying to sell into the scene. It’s being built from inside the booth, by someone who knows what it feels like when your tracks don’t line up, your tags are chaos, and the crowd is waiting.**

This is for all of us who’ve thought: *there has to be a better way.*

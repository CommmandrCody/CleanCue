## üìä Analysis Improvements

### Before vs After
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Key Detection | All tracks "C# major" | Diverse, accurate keys (F# minor 11A, C# major 3B, etc.) |
| Energy Values | Identical 0.4-0.5 range | Professional 3.0-7.0 range matching DJ standards |
| BPM Accuracy | Basic estimation | Scientific onset-based detection |
| Engine Transparency | Hidden algorithms | User-visible engine selection (Librosa/KeyFinder/Essentia) |

### Technical Implementation
- **scripts/analyze_audio.py**: Librosa-based scientific analysis with proper key profiles
- **scripts/keyfinder_analysis.py**: Circle of Fifths algorithm for DJ-focused key detection
- **scripts/essentia_analysis.js**: Research-grade MIR algorithms (ready for dependencies)

## üéõÔ∏è Normalization Workflow

### Analysis Scripts
- **scripts/loudness_analysis.py**: EBU R128 loudness measurement using ffmpeg
- **scripts/normalize_metadata.py**: ReplayGain tag application for non-destructive normalization
- **scripts/normalize_export.py**: Export mode with normalized copy creation

### Tested Results
```bash
Original Track:  -10.9 LUFS, -0.3 dBFS peak, 11.6 LRA
Normalized:      -12.6 LUFS, -1.5 dBFS peak (excellent result within DJ standards)
```

### UI Integration
- **Mode Selection**: Metadata-only, Export, or Both modes with real-time explanations
- **Preset System**: DJ (-14 LUFS), Streaming, Broadcast, and Custom presets
- **Advanced Controls**: Custom LUFS/Peak/LRA values, limiter options, format selection
- **Export Management**: Directory selection, file naming, and progress tracking
